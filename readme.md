# Book Recommendation System

## Overview

Welcome to the Book Recommendation System! This application provides personalized book recommendations based on user ratings and book content. The system leverages both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to suggest books that you might enjoy. This project showcases a combination of machine learning models and Django web framework to create a robust recommendation engine.

## Features

- **User Ratings**: View and manage book ratings for different users.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get book recommendations based on user preferences.
- **Hybrid Recommendation System**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved accuracy.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface built with Bootstrap.

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection

The system collects user ratings for various books. This data is stored in a database and used to train the recommendation models.

### 2. Content-Based Filtering

Content-based filtering recommends items by comparing item features. This technique analyzes the characteristics of the books, such as the title, author, and other metadata, and suggests those that match the user's previous preferences.

**Algorithm**: TF-IDF Vectorization and Nearest Neighbors
- **Type**: Unsupervised Learning
- **Steps**:
  1. Represent each item using TF-IDF vectors based on the textual content.
  2. Compute similarities between items using cosine similarity.
  3. Recommend items that are most similar to the ones the user has previously liked.

### 3. Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering predicts a user's interests by collecting preferences from many users. This approach is used to find similarities between users and suggest books that similar users have liked.

**Algorithm**: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- **Type**: Supervised Learning
- **Steps**:
  1. Construct a user-item matrix where each entry represents the rating given by a user to an item.
  2. Decompose this matrix into three lower-dimensional matrices (U, Î£, V^T) using SVD.
  3. Predict missing ratings by computing the dot product of the user and item feature vectors.

### 4. Hybrid Recommendation System

The hybrid model combines collaborative and content-based filtering to provide more accurate recommendations. It leverages the strengths of both methods to enhance the quality of the recommendations.

**Algorithm**: Combination of TF-IDF Vectorization, Nearest Neighbors, and SVD
- **Type**: Combination of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
- **Steps**:
  1. Generate content-based recommendations by finding items similar to those the user has rated.
  2. Apply collaborative filtering on the content-based recommendations to predict ratings.
  3. Combine the results to provide the final recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data analysis and manipulation library for Python.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
- **Surprise**: A Python scikit for building and analyzing recommender systems that deal with explicit rating data.
- **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
